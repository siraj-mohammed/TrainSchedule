# TrainSchedule
## Overview

This app can be accessed [here](https://siraj-mohammed.github.io/TrainSchedule/)

The app leverages Google Firebase to host train schedule data. It retrieves that information and displays it on screen. The app uses Moment.js to manipulate the date and provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely the train name, scheduled arrival time, and the number of minutes that remain until the next train arrives at the station.

It also allows the user to add new train information such as the train name, destination, start time and frequency. It then sends that information to Firebase and also adds that new train information on screen.
